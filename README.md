## Hi there! 👋
I am a third year student at UC San Diego.
This page is designed as a programming portfolio for my course in EDS124BR, Teaching Computational Thinking for Everyone!
I have a basic understanding of coding from middle school and high school, I seek to improve my knowledge in the field through this course. 
Join me in my journey!
